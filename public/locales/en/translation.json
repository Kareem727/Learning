    "Ask_p3":"IELTS, TOEFL, SAT, ACT, and GRE are the top five standardized tests for students and non-native English learners among hundreds of English language tests worldwide. Data is based on the annual number of test-takers and confirmed by the number of lessons with online test prep tutors on Preply. IELTS is accepted by most American, Australian, British, Canadian, Irish, and New Zealand academic institutions, and many more across the world. In particular, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom use IELTS scores as proof of prospective immigrants' competence in English. More specifically, IELTS uses British English and is generally favored by the United Kingdom and institutions in Commonwealth nations, such as New Zealand and Australia. On the other hand, the TOEFL tests your ability to communicate in English in academic settings. Administered by US-based organization the Education Testing Service, TOEFL uses American English. It is accepted by thousands of institutions across many countries, including the UK, USA, and Australia, as well as all of the world’s top 100 universities. It can also satisfy the required language component for student, post-study, skilled migration, and business visas in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.",

    "Fil_1":"Take The World's Best Courses",
    "Fil_2":"Given the improvements in delivery methods, online learning environments provide a greater degree of flexibility than traditional classroom settings. Online platforms can also offer more diverse representations of student populations as learners prepare for working in the twenty-first century. The diversity comes from interacting with students outside of one's geographical location, possibly offering a variety of perspectives on course content. Courses offered completely online are primarily delivered in an asynchronous learning or synchronous learning format.",
